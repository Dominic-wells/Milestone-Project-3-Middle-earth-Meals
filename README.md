Middle Earth Meals is a comprehensive, full-stack web application developed using the Flask framework and MongoDB as the underlying database. This project aims to provide a platform for users to manage recipes inspired by the rich cultures within J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth universe. The application implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionalities, allowing users to interact with the recipe database effectively.

The platform is designed to cater to both registered and non-registered users, providing access to the extensive collection of recipes. Users who create an account can fully utilize the features offered by Middle Earth Meals, including adding new recipes, editing and deleting their own entries, and managing their account details.

The primary objective of this project is to create a seamless experience for users to discover, share, and collaborate on Middle Earth-inspired culinary creations, fostering a vibrant community of food enthusiasts and Tolkien fans. Middle Earth Meals serves as a robust and reliable platform for users to explore, create, and appreciate the diverse flavors of Middle Earth.

- Golden Yellow (#fec354) - evoking the aura of magical artifacts (color of a ring)

### Responsiveness

The website aims to provide a fast and user-friendly experience for all users, regardless of whether they are accessing it from a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. Extensive testing has been conducted on all three platforms to ensure optimal performance. The site's design is adaptable to different screen sizes and device types, with layout adjustments made accordingly to ensure usability across all formats. The primary means of achieving this responsiveness is through the use of the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

# Testing Tools

- <details><summary>W3C CSS Validator</summary><img src="/static/images/css Validator.png></details>
- <details><summary>Lighthouse report</summary><img src="/static/images/LightHouse.png></details>
- <details><summary>CIPepe8 Python validator</summary><img src="/static/images/Pythonpass.png></details>

Tested all HTML files using the W3C Markup Validation Service, which pointed out several errors due to the use of Jinja2 templating language. However, no other errors were detected in the HTML pages.

# Errors and Bugs

- Toggle bar will sometimes display over the logo
- Issue with adding square brackets to the Preparation_steps and Ingredients. The issue was that when it was splitting the ingredients and preparation steps by the newline character (\n), it was including the newline character in the resulting list. This means that each item in the list had a trailing newline character, which was causing the square brackets to appear in the template. Using the strip() method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each item in the list, I was able to remove the newline character and fix the issue.

## Database

MongoDB, a non-relational database, was utilized to store the collections outlined below. These collections were held in MemDb

###### categories

This collection stores user account information. Each document in the collection has the following fields:

- \_id: A unique ObjectId automatically generated by MongoDB to identify each document.
- Username: A string representing the user's username.
- Password: A string containing the user's password, which is stored using the secure SHA256 hashing algorithm to ensure data privacy and security.

The database used in this project, MemDb, is an in-memory database that stores the data in the server's memory. It provides high performance and low latency access to the data, making it a suitable choice for this application.
